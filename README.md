## Installation

To use this application, the user must first install inquirer by running 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' in the command line. After installing inquirer, run 'node index to launch the application. Respond to each prompt that appears in the terminal. Once you have answered all the prompts, a README file will be generated in your current working directory.
